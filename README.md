**Medical Images Analysis in Patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis**  
_MSc Data Science Thesis Project_

---

## Overview

This repository contains the code, results and documentation for a Master of Data Science thesis focused on the trainig of machine learning models for the detection and classification of **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)** using [histopathology images / ... / etc.].

The goal is to explore and evaluate different machine learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy in EoE cases.

---

## Thesis Objectives/Tasks

- Preprocess and analyze [data source]
- Train and evaluate ML models for EoE detection/classification
- Provide reproducible, well-documented research code

---

## Materials and Methods

- Data preprocessing: [e.g., normalization, augmentation, etc.]
- Algorithms:
  - [Model 1: e.g., Logistic Regression]
  - [Model 2: e.g., Random Forest]
  - [Model 3: e.g., CNN (if image-based)]
- Evaluation Metrics: [e.g., Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC, etc.]
